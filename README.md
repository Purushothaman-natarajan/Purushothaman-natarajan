# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Purushothaman Natarajan

I'm into deep learning, specializing in computer vision and NLP. With over 2 years of experience in machine learning and a background in mechanical engineering, I bring a unique perspective to my work.

ðŸ”¬ Currently, I'm immersed in the fascinating world of underwater sonar imagery, working on a project funded by DRDO (Defence Research and Development Organization).

ðŸ’¼ I've previously collaborated with Amazon and am currently a Research Fellow at SRM University, Chennai, India.
